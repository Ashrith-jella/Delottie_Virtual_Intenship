# Task 1
Using a data unification algorithm, the tech team at our client, Daikibo, has converted all telemetry data collected from its 4 factories:

- Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
- Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
- Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
- Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

  
Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 mins. Daikibo has been collecting this data for one month (May 2021) and they've shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.

The reason the client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

In which location did machines break the most?
What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

# Task 2

We have processed all data on employee compensation and generated an Excel file (Equality Table.xlsx, available in the Resources) containing 3 columns:

- Factory
- Job Role
- Equality Score (integer; ranging between -100 and +100; 0 is ideal)

  
Here is your task:

Create a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score into 3 types:
- Fair (+-10)
- Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
- Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)

Examples:
- 6 → Fair
- -9 → Unfair
- -30 → Highly Discriminative

Please find the Equality Table you need to edit in the resources below. When you are done, upload the edited version of the file.
